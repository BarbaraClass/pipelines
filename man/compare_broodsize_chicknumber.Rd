\title{Compare brood size with number of chicks captured}
\usage{
compare_broodsize_chicknumber(Brood_data, Capture_data, Individual_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{Brood_data}{Data frame. Brood data output from pipeline.}

\item{Capture_data}{Data frame. Capture data output from pipeline.}

\item{Individual_data}{Data frame. Individual data output from pipeline.}
}
\value{
A list of:
\item{CheckList}{A summary dataframe of whether the check resulted in any warnings or errors.}
\item{WarningOutput}{A list of row-by-row warnings.}
\item{ErrorOutput}{A list of row-by-row errors.}
}
\description{
Compare BroodSize in Brood_data with the number of chicks captured in Capture_data. We expect these numbers to be equal. Records where BroodSize is larger than the number of chicks captured results in a warning, because chicks might have died before ringing and measuring. Records where BroodSize is smaller than the number of chicks captured results in an error, because this should not be possible.
