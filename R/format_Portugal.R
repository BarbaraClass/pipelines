#' Construct standard summary for data from Choupal, Portugal.
#'
#' A pipeline to produce a standard output for the great tit population
#' in Choupal, Portugal, administered by the University of Coimbra.
#' Output follows the HNB standard breeding data format.
#'
#' This section provides details on data management choices that are unique to this data.
#' For a general description of the standard format please see XXXXX PLACE HOLDER!
#'
#' \strong{NumberFledged}: This population has no estimation of actual fledgling numbers.
#' The last time nests are counted is 14 days post hatching. We use this as an estimation of fledling numbers.
#' This also affects \emph{ClutchType_calc} as \emph{NumberFledged} is used to estimated second clutches.
#'
#' \strong{MinAge, RingAge}: Any individual caught as a chick was assumed to
#' have a EUring code of 1: 'Pullus: nestling or chick, unable to fly freely, still able to be caught by hand.'
#' Any individual not caught as a chick was assumed to have a EUring code of 4:
#' 'After first full year: year of hatching unknown'.
#'
#' \strong{ClutchType_observed}: In the raw data, there is no distinction between 'second' and 'replacement' clutches.
#' Any clutch recorded as '2nd' is assumed to be a 'second' clutch under our definitions.
#' 'ClutchType_calc' may give a more appropriate estimate of clutch type for this data.
#' @param db Location of database file.
#' @param Species A numeric vector. Which species should be included (EUring codes)? If blank will return all major species (see details below).
#' @param path Location where output csv files will be saved.
#'
#' @return Generates 5 .csv files with data in a standard format.
