# Standard utility functions
#
# Standard utility functions are functions that generate additional variables that are not part of standard format but can be added to pipeline outputs when requested by the user. Often these variables are not obtained from direct observations in the field but derived from other variables (e.g., an individual's age is derived from its year of ringing/birth and the current year).
#
# Optional variables:
# - breedingSeason, calc_season()
# - calculatedClutchType, calc_clutchtype()
# - nestAttemptNumber, calc_nestattempt()
# - calculatedSex, calc_sex()
# - exactAge, calc_age()
# - minimumAge, calc_age()
